and understand what does each entry contain. Then in reference to that make a dataframe with column name mentioned in the URL. Extract each element from the entry of the log file like user address,timeand date. Then we parse the log and for doing this first we need to identify the string and find similarity in them. Based on the observation, split the data and put them in dataframe. 

By using visual elements like graphs, charts and maps, presented our results like top 5 address, top 5 page/ geographical plotting.
and then the last task  was to work on time series analysis.
